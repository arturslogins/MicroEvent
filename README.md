## Introduction
We live in a highly connected world.
Motre and more critical services are available through the internet and become essential parts of our life.
Many countries have now ratified the decision to create a shared group of highly skilled professional with the only goal of monitoring and keep these crucial systems online.

Congratulations, you have been selected among thousands to help us in this endeavour!

You will manage the ParsonsSys for your country!

## High Level Overview

Above you can have a look at our high-level architectural drawing.
Each team will represent a country and will have to run the ParsonsSys on a local datacenter (your laptops).

It does not work out of the box, of course.
Your goal is to pass successfully a set of [challenges](#challenges) designed to help you to master the system and wire it to the ParsonsNet.
